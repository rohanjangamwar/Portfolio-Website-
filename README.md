This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully static site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to showcase my work, skills, and professional experience in a clean and responsive layout. The project includes a main landing page (`index.html`) located in the `Rohan` folder, along with an `assets` directory containing all supporting files such as custom stylesheets, JavaScript functionality, images, and a downloadable resume.

The website features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, smooth animations for enhanced user experience, a project gallery with visual effects, and integration of the Swiper.js library for interactive carousel components. It is lightweight, fast-loading, and suitable for deployment on any static hosting platform.

To view the website locally, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file found in the `Rohan` directory using any modern web browser. No additional setup or dependencies are required. The project structure is straightforward and easy to navigate, making it simple for others to explore or contribute if desired.

Technologies used in this project include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Swiper.js. All visual assets and resources are stored in an organized `img` subfolder within `assets`. You are welcome to explore the code, use it as inspiration, or adapt it for your own portfolio.
